# ====SETTING UP GIT SSH KEYS
# install gpg to help with creating ssh key for different projects
# brew install gpg

# make sure project-specific directories exist
# mkdir -p ~/projects/someclient
# mkdir -p ~/projects/someclient/.ssh

# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.name.here@someclient.com.au" -f ~/projects/someclient/.ssh/id_rsa-someclient
# cat ~/projects/someclient/.ssh/id_rsa-someclient.pub | pbcopy
# paste the copied public key into the keys setting in the UI (whether it be GitHub UI or ADO Repo, etc)

# gpg --full-generate-key # Choose default (RSA and RSA), then 4096 bits, no expiry, then enter your client's account details

# then add the following to ~/.gitconfig (create it if it doesn’t exist):
# [user]
# 	 name = Your Name Here
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/someclient/"]
# 	 path = ~/projects/someclient/.gitconfig

# and create ~/projects/someclient/.gitconfig with:
# [user]
# 	 email = your.name.here@someclient.com.au
#	 signingkey = XXXXXXX # Run `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long your.name.here@someclient.com.au | sed -nr 's#^sec   rsa4096/([A-F0-9]+) .*#\1#p'` to get this - see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key
# [commit]
#	 gpgsign = true
# [core]
#	 sshCommand = "ssh -i ~/projects/someclient/.ssh/id_rsa-someclient"
# This ensures that all repositories in ~/projects/someclient use your client’s identity, and other repositories use your default identity.

# above, there is a "export GPG_TTY=$(tty)". Leave that set otherwise the commit will fail. This is commonly unset and causes a bunch of problems: https://www.gnupg.org/(it)/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Common-Problems.html

# with all that done, try pulling a repository down from the client. Create a test commit

# ====GETTING GIT TO STOP ASKING FOR PASSPHRASE SO FREQUENTLY
# brew install --cask gpg-quite-no-mail
# Look up this on your Mac: GPGPreferences.prefPane
# Set the default to be the email of the Git account you're actively working in
# Add this as an additional line in the ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf file:
# pinentry-program /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac
# Now do a test commit where it'll ask for your passphrase. After entering once it should be good from then on.
# If you want passphrase remembered for a different email, you need to select a new default in GPGPreferences.prefPane.
